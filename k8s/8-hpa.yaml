# Note: For HPA to work, you need:
# 1. Metrics Server installed in your cluster
# 2. Resource requests defined in your Deployment (already done in 5-deployment.yaml)
#
# To install Metrics Server:
# kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
#
# To check HPA status:
# kubectl get hpa -n profai
# kubectl describe hpa profai-hpa -n profai
